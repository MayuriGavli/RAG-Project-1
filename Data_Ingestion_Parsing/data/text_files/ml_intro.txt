Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) where systems learn from data and improve their performance automatically without being explicitly programmed for every task.
Instead of writing rules, you provide the machine with data + algorithms, and it figures out patterns, makes predictions, or decisions.
