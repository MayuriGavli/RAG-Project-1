Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that deals with creating machines or software capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. 
 These tasks include reasoning, learning, decision making, problem solving, understanding language, and perception.
John McCarthy (who coined the term in 1956) defined AI as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.”
