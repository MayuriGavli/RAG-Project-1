    "Chunking is not just splitting text—it’s an optimization problem balancing context, retrieval accuracy, and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes ✅ — overlap in chunking is definitely beneficial in RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why Overlap Helps\n",
    "\n",
    "Preserves continuity → If an important idea is split between two chunks, overlap ensures both chunks have enough context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improves retrieval → Search engines (vector or keyword) can match a query to either chunk without missing part of the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduces hallucination → LLM doesn’t get isolated fragments that don’t make sense alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exmaple - Chunk A: \"The contract requires both parties to comply with...\"\n",
    "          Chunk B: \"...comply with all safety regulations. Failure to do so...\"   \n",
    "          \n",
    "          👉 Now each chunk makes sense independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 2. When Overlap is Most Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "When chunks are cut mid-sentence or mid-paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "For legal, medical, or technical docs where small missing context can change meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using embedding/vector search, since embeddings work better if chunks are self-contained.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 3. How Much Overlap?\n",
    "\n",
    "Small overlap (50–100 tokens) is usually enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Too little overlap → risk of losing context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Too much overlap → duplicates increase storage cost and slow retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Sweet spot: ~10–20% of chunk size.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chunk size = 500 tokens → Overlap = 50–100 tokens."
